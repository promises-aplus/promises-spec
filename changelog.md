# Promises/A+ Changelog

## [Version 1.1][] / 2013-??-??

- Specified that `onFulfilled` and `onRejected` must be called as functions, with no `this` value.
- Separated out the concept of a possibly-nonconformant "thenable" from the concept of a conformant "promise."
- Specified the Promise Resolution Procedure, instead of leaving the mechanism for adopting a thenable's state unspecified. In particular, the recursive nature of the now-specified procedure improves upon the na√Øve suggestion given in version 1.0, and many possible edge-cases are nailed down.
- Added a definition for "exception."

## [Version 1.0][] / 2012-12-06

- Initial release. For differences from its predecessor, the Promises/A specification, see [Differences from Promises/A](differences-from-promises-a.md).
